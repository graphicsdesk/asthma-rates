The average values are also all higher than the EPA’s 24 hour PM2.5 standard of 35 micrograms/cubic meter. A PurpleAir sensor in Manhattanville, for example, measured values greater than the EPA’s 24-hour standard 81 percent of the time in the past three days. Sensors in East Harlem and Hamilton Heights were over the 24-hour-standard 76 percent and 60 percent of the time, respectively.
